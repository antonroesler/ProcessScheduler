# ProcessScheduler
A Visualization of Scheduling Algorithms using pure python with dash and plotly

Here is a five minute demo video on my Youtube Channel: https://youtu.be/5KJTk0CCvX0

My goal was a nicely layouted and interaktiv app that visualizes Scheduling Algorithms. The Scheduler.py Class is where all the Algorithms are implemented. The ProcessList can read a csv file with Processes in the form of 'name,duration,arrival' in it, or one can simply add Processes by hand. This customizable ProcessList can then be schduled by any of the six algoruthms ()
